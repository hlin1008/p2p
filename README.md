# Peer-to-Peer Chat System

A Python-based peer-to-peer (P2P) chat system with centralized registration and local GUI-based messaging. The system allows clients to register with a central server, connect to other clients directly, and maintain persistent message logs using SQLite.

---

## Features

- Peer-to-peer messaging with direct socket connections
- Central server for client discovery and registration
- Local SQLite database for message history
- Tkinter-based GUI for sending and receiving messages
- Modular code with separate handlers for client, database, and UI

---

## Project Structure

```
p2p-main/
│
├── server/
│   └── server.py              # Handles client registration and user list management
│
├── client/
│   ├── client_chat_handler.py # Client-side P2P communication logic
│   ├── database_handler.py    # Handles SQLite database storage of chat history
│   └── gui.py                 # Tkinter GUI frontend
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `socket`, `sqlite3`, `tkinter`, `threading`)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server
In a terminal:
```bash
cd server
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Launch Clients
Open two more terminals for separate clients:
```bash
cd client
python gui.py
(Db files would be autogenerated)
```
---

## Testing

- No unit tests yet. But, plan to implement:
- Client registration and reconnection
- Message sending and persistence
- SQLite message retrieval

You can use Python’s built-in `unittest` module for coverage.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add encryption (e.g., RSA for key exchange, AES for message encryption)
- Include chat history viewer in GUI
- Add WebSocket support for better scalability
- Group chat or file-sharing support
